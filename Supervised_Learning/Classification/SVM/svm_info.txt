Used for both classification and regression tasks

The primary objective is to identify the optimal hyperplane in an N dimensional space
that can spearate data points into different classes in the feature space

The choice for the best hyperplane is the one that maximizes the spearation margine 
between the two classes

The maximum margin hyperplane is selected based on maximizing the distance between 
the hyperplane and the nearest data point on each side. We choose the hyperplane whose
distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized

For a binary classification problem, the equation for the linear hyperplane can be written as
 w^T x + b = 0
    - The vector w represents the normal vector to the hyperplane.
    - b represents the offset or distance of the hyu=perplane from the origin along the vector w
